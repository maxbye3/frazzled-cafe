                        Frazzled Cafe moved online from Spring 2020. Since then we have a seven-day a week programme and
                        offer three
                        types of meetings almost every day. All of our meetings provide the same safe space to share,
                        talk and
                        listen. We suggest you try each type of meeting, so you can find one that's right for you.

                    <p class="text-center">A large Frazzled Cafe meeting with Ruby Wax, usually held three times a week,
                        for around
                        100 people, and which lasts for an hour.
                        Facilitator meetings are held most days of the week for around 12 people and last for an hour.
                        Host meetings are held every day and are for around 12 people, and last for 45 minutes.

                    <p class="text-center">
                        Facilitators have had full Frazzled Cafe training.
                        Most have been with the charity for a number of years and have a professional background in
                        mental wellbeing
                        support.
                        Hosts joined the charity in Spring 2020 when our meetings first went online.
                        They too have had Frazzled Cafe training and Mental Health First Aid training.
                        Many of our Hosts also volunteer for other mental wellbeing initiatives.

                    Frazzled Cafe Facilitated meetings run for 45 minutes to an hour and start with a run-through of our
                    guidelines.
                    This is to ensure confidentiality is respected and that there is safe environment for those that
                    would like to share.</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p1">
                    Each meeting opens and closes with a short mindfulness exercise.
                    You don't need to ever have tried mindfulness before, and your participation in these exercises is
                    completely optional.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After the mindfulness exercise, if you would like to speak, all attendees can unmute themselves and
                    talk
                    about how they are feeling, or to borrow one of Ruby's expressions, 'explain what the weather
                    conditions are like in your head'.
                </p>

                <p class="p1">
                    Attendees usually speak for 1-2 minutes to ensure
                    everyone that would like to has the opportunity to speak. You can of course speak more than once.
                    Speaking is optional. If you would just like to listen, that is perfectly OK. In all meetings, and
                    in between people speaking, we expect some silences and those are normal.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p1">The facilitator's role is to ensure everyone that would like to speak gets a chance to,
                    that the topics
                    of conversation are appropriate for the space and that attendees are both present and respectful of
                    the space and one another.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p1">
                    After the closing mindfulness exercise and the end
                    of the meeting, we recommend attendees take a few minutes to reflect and decompress before returning
                    to their usual routine.</p>

                    Yes - but not too much! We open in the same way with the host welcoming everyone, running through
                    the meeting settings and guidelines, popping a
                    short poll onto your screen and introducing Ruby who leads the mindfulness exercise, bringing
                    everyone together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ruby then opens the floor to anyone who would like to share - letting the group know
                    about the "weather conditions in their head". The host will call upon those with their virtual hands
                    up that would like to speak (we cannot guarantee everyone will be called upon, but we do our best to
                    get
                    through as many as we can in the time we have).

                <p>
                    After a few people have shared, we then breakout into smaller groups, still in Zoom.
                    Here you'll have the opportunity to talk in a smaller group with up
                    to 8 people.
                    <br>
                    After around 15 minutes we re-group into the main room and reopen the floor for
                    anyone that would like to share. To end, we close the meeting with Ruby leading her mindfulness
                    exercise
                    and a second poll to get some feedback and helpful information.
